## II. Development History

- **Origin (1963):** IEEE was formed through the merger of the *American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, founded 1884)* and the *Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE, founded 1912)*, establishing a strong foundation in the electrical and electronic domains.  

- **Digitization (1980s‚Äì1990s):** With the rise of computer technology, IEEE began digitizing its extensive publication archives, initially distributed via CD-ROMs.  
- **Internet Era (1998):** The launch of the **IEEE Xplore Digital Library** marked a new era of online access, enabling efficient literature search and retrieval.  
- **Continuous Evolution (21st Century‚ÄìPresent):** IEEE Xplore has undergone multiple upgrades, incorporating citation analysis, personalized recommendations, and mobile compatibility. The platform continues to expand its content types‚Äîsuch as eBooks and online courses‚Äîaiming to deliver an integrated and user-friendly research experience.
