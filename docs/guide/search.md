### **1. üîé Global Search**
![Global Search](../src/guide/global.png)
By default, IEEE Xplore searches only the **metadata**. You can limit the search to specific fields using **Boolean expressions**.

**Example:**

```
"Abstract":ofdm AND "Publication Title":communications
```

The platform automatically normalizes British/American spelling, singular/plural forms, and verb tenses, and offers type-ahead keyword suggestions.

**Searchable Fields:**

  * `"Abstract"`
  * `"Publication Title"` (journal or conference title)
  * `"Document Title"` (article title)
  * `"Author"`
  * `"Affiliation"` (author‚Äôs institution)
  * `"Standard Number"`
  * `"ISBN"/"ISSN"/"DOI"`

-----

### **2. ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Search**
![Advanced Search](../src/guide/advanced.png)
  * **Access:** Click **‚ÄúAdvanced Search‚Äù** beneath the main search box.

  ::: tip
   **How to use:**
    * **Fill in the three-line template**: choose ==**‚Äúfield ‚Äì operator ‚Äì search term‚Äù**==; add more rows as needed.
    * Supports **‚ÄúAND / OR / NOT‚Äù**; ==parentheses `()` for nesting are **‚Äúnot‚Äù** supported.==
    * Use the options at the bottom of the page to limit publication years.
  :::

-----

### **3. ‚å®Ô∏è Command Search**
![Command Search](../src/guide/command.png)
  * **Access point:** **‚ÄúCommand Search‚Äù**, located to the right of Advanced Search.
  ::: tip
  * **How to use:** The syntax is identical to the single-box search, but it provides field buttons and respects parenthesis priority, making it ideal for complex strategies.
  :::

**Example:**

```
("Abstract":GAN OR "Keyword":adversarial) AND ("Publication Title":medicine OR "Publication Title":biology)
```

This mode supports `NEAR`/`ONEAR` operators, nested parentheses, and has a query length limit of 40 words.

-----

### **4. üßë‚Äçüî¨ Author Search**
![Author Search](../src/guide/author.png)
This feature lets you quickly locate papers by a specific author.

  * **Access:** Choose **‚ÄúAuthors‚Äù** from the drop-down menu on the left side of the top search box.
  
  ::: warning
  * **Points to remember:**
      * The platform searches all fields and is ==**not case-sensitive**==.
      * **Wildcards** are allowed, but at least three letters must be given in either the first or last name (e.g., `M*ke Jone` is valid; `J*y` is not).
      * Citation downloads display the normalized form: ==surname plus first-name initials==.
      * The selected author name appears at the top of the results; a small **‚Äúx‚Äù** beside it lets you remove that filter.
      * Use the left-hand facet panel to refine the results further.
  :::

### **5. üìö Publication Retrieval**

* You can select the **type** of publication you need to find and quickly locate it by searching by keywords.
*	You can search by the **first letter** of the publication or click By Topic to filter a second time by discipline.If you select a discipline type, you can still filter again by the first letter of the publication.
*	You can also refine your search results using the **cluster analysis bar** (Refine results by) on the left side of the page. Sort By and Items Per Page adjust the number of titles displayed per page and the sorting order.
*	You can find the publication you need and directly click on the title to access its journal page (journals and magazines) or abstract (standards, e-books, and online courses).Some journals offer the option to download entire issues.

| **All authors** | Lists all individuals credited with authorship. Names may link to author-specific detail pages. |
| **Author affiliations** | The organizations (e.g., university, corporation) associated with each author at the time of publication. |

| **Publication or conference date** | The date the document was officially published or presented. |
| **DOI** | Digital Object Identifier (DOI). A unique, persistent link to the online location of the document. |
| **Document-type icon** | A visual icon that identifies the document's publication format (e.g., Journal, Conference Paper, Standard). |
| **Citation counts** | The total number of times the document has been cited by other publications, often separated into paper and patent citations. |
| **Full-text views/downloads** | A usage metric counting the total views and/or downloads of the full-text document. |
| **Access indicator** | An icon (e.g., üîì) or label ("Open Access") that indicates the full text is available to download without a subscription. |

### **Sorting the results**

Seven sort options are available:
![Sort Options](../src/guide/options.png)
1.  `Relevance` (default)
2.  `Newest First`
3.  `Oldest First`
4.  `Most Cited by Papers`
5.  `Most Cited by Patents`
6.  `Most Popular` (by download/view volume)
7.  `Publication Title A‚ÄìZ / Z‚ÄìA`

-----

### **Refining the results**
![Refine Results](../src/guide/refine.png)

Use the **left-hand facet panel** for:

  * `Search within results` (secondary search)
  * `Content Type` (journal, conference, standard, etc.)
  * `Publication Year` (drag the year slider)
  * `Author` (only names in the current result set)
  * `Affiliation` (only institutions in the current result set)
  * `Topic / Publisher / IEEE Technical Society`

::: note
==Multiple selections can be combined, and counts refresh instantly.==
::: 
-----

### **Secondary search**
![Secondary Search](../src/guide/secondary.png)

Type a new term in the **‚ÄúSearch within results‚Äù** box at the top of the page, or select facets on the left. The query is automatically combined with the previous one using **AND**.

  * For example, after searching for `Java`, entering `XML` in the secondary box is equivalent to searching for `Java AND XML`.
